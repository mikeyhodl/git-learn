Start a New React Project
If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.

You can use React without a framework, however we’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.

By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, and avoid essentially building your own framework later.
